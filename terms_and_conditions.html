If you fail to sell the item after you have agreed to do so, you may be liable for breach of contract, resulting in liability for monetary damages, direct or consequential, at law and possibly even specific performance at equity. It is your obligation to ensure that you are able to complete the transaction prior to submitting the item for sale through picSell.</p>

<ul class="circle">
<li>Sellers shall submit 3 pictures of the item to be sold along with the brand name, model and an appropriate title for the item. A short description may also be provided.</li>
<li>We will review the submission and determine, in our sole discretion, whether we will list the item for sale. We will notify you either way.</li>
<li>If we are willing to sell the item for you, we will provide you with a price range you would receive upon a successful sale. The price range quoted to you will be net of all fees incurred (listing, picSell fees and any other applicable fees).</li>
<li>If we are unable to sell your item in 3 weeks, we will notify you that we can either relist your item at a lower price or remove your listing. If we remove your listing, you will not be subject to any fees whatsoever.</li>
<li>If you accept our price range, we will work to sell your item. You may not list, sell or otherwise dispose of your item while it is listed through picSell. You are responsible to notify us immediately s if the item that you have submitted is no longer available for sale.</li>

</ul>
<h2>What Happens When an Item is Sold?</h2>
<ul class="circle">
<li>After a buyer purchases a seller’s item we email you pre-paid, insured shipping label. The seller packs the item in the box and schedules a UPS/USPS pickup (as applicable) or takes the package to the nearest drop off location. The seller must ship the packaged item directly to the buyer within 2 days of being notified that the item has sold.</li>
<li>In order to establish that that item has been shipped by the seller, the seller shall be required to provide either a shipping receipt from the carrier or show via the tracking number that the item has been shipped.</li>
<li>Buyer will have 14 days to make a claim that the item is damaged or does not match the description of the item in the listing. If the buyer has no complaints within the 14-day period, we will directly transfer the agreed amount to the seller via PayPal, bank account or check (your choice).</li>
<li>If the Buyer makes a substantiated claim that the item is damaged or does not match the description in the listing, the buyer shall be entitled to a full refund, including shipping fees and return shipping fees. The seller shall be required to pay the cost of both the original and return shipping fees.</li>

</ul>
<h2>picSell will assist both parties in case of the exceptions below:</h2>
<ul class="circle">
<li>If seller does not ship the item within the 2-day period described above, the buyer shall be entitled to a refund.</li>
<li>If the item is lost in transit, the buyer receives a refund and the seller must seek compensation from the carrier. We will initiate the remediation process with the carrier for the seller.</li>
<li>If the item is damaged or not as described, we will work with buyer and seller to determine the appropriate course of action. If the buyer’s claim is substantiated, the buyer will have the option of (i) keeping the item, in which case the seller will receive payment, or (ii) returning the item and obtaining a full refund (including shipping fees). If the item is damaged in transit and the buyer returns the items, the seller must seek compensation from the carrier. We will initiate the remediation process with the carrier and the insurance company.</li>
